 * GitHub accounts shown as maintainers on /requests.

 * remote images this app loads are these accounts' avatars, so the optimizer
 * is pinned to exactly these paths rather than all of `github.com/*.png`.
 * Without that, `/_next/image` would fetch and transcode any GitHub avatar on
 * request. Add a maintainer here and both the page and the allowlist follow.
